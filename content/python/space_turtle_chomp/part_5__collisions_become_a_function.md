### Part 5

# Collisions become a function

You have collision checking working but as we add more cabbages it makes the
 code easier if you convert your existing collision code to a function.

Step 1.  To create as a function we will use the `is_collision` to return a
 True or False return, to do that type the following at the end of the
 `#Define functions` section:

```python
def is_collision(turtle_1, turtle_2):
       distance = math.sqrt(math.pow(turtle_1.xcor()-turtle_2.xcor(),2) + math.pow(turtle_1.ycor()-turtle_2.ycor(),2))
       if distance < 20:
           return True
       else:
           return False
```

So your function uses turtle_1 and turtle_2 as generic terms instead of turtle and food and
 uses the same collision formula as before with an if statement that returns a
 True vales if they are in the same location \(collide\) and a False value when
 they donâ€™t.

Step 2.  Now you need to update the code within the while True loop
 \# Collision checking section to look like:

```python
# Collision checking
if is_collision(player, food):
    food.setposition(random.randint(-290, 290), random.randint(-290, 290))
```

Step 3.  Save your game as kbgame5 and run your module.

Your code should now look like this: [kbgame5.py](/python_game/src/kbgame5.py)
